Personal Portfolio

## Description
Create a personal portfolio showcasing advanced CSS skills. For this challenge I utilized HTML and CSS as the framework for a "live-time' buildable portfolio. This portfolio was actually created with my dog, Ryker, in mind, as he will be searching for a position as a therapy dog in the coming weeks. Certain areas contain placeholders while the information is still being developed. The goal, as my coding skills progress, is to use this template to showcase my own projects as they become available.

## Tasks Completed
Created a header with name and functional links to sections within the website and to a resume.

Displayed a portrait.

Added sections that included a brief biography placeholder, work history/progress, and a contact me list.

Allowed the links in the 'work' and 'contact me' sections to be functional to external sources.

Applied features in CSS to incoporate advanced elements such as: flexbox, grids, pseudoelements, variables and use on different size screens using media query.

Put comments throughout HTML and CSS denoting the start of each section for content and styling.

##
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Installation

[Link to deployed website](https://nicosbott.github.io/rbott-portfolio/)

## Usage
Click any of the first three navigation links within top header to drop to associated section in the main body area.

Click on the fourth navigation link to bring up resume within the "self" of application. Note: resume is currently under construction.

Click on any of the five place card images within the work section to navigate to associated webpage, within "self" application.

Click on any of the three navigation links in the contact me section to be directed to corresponding function of the clickable title.

Hovering over navigation links creates effects, such as changes in borders, text color, backgroud color, shadowing, and figcaptions to appear.

Acitivating navigation links within header and contact me section creates an effect as if the element is being depressed, by making the element smaller in size. 

When used on smaller media, such as a cellphone, all the content on main page wraps and drops into a single column format. 

## Credits
